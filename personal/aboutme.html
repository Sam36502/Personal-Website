    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        So you want to know about me?
        Well, there's not much to know.
        <br>
        For one thing, I really don't like writing about myself, but
        it feels appropriate for a personal website to write something about
        me here so, here's the summary:
    </p>

    <h2>"Where are you from?"</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Switzerland, raised in New Zealand, England
        and then mostly in Switzerland, but somehow I feel more British
        than anything. I can speak English and German (as well as
        Swiss-German) and now Toki Pona. I prefer to speak English
	where possible as I'm more able to articulate what I want to
	say, but regularly use German in my day-to-day life as well.
	My English accent is kinda weird as it's pretty much a mix of
	lots of different ones, but I think I'm pretty decent at
	imitating accents, so I guess you could say it's anything I want.
    </p>

    <h2>"What kind of stuff do you like?"</h2>
    <p>
        Sadly, I have very few pronounced interests and those are
        not at all very pronounced. I like to read, but not sometimes.
        I like to play games, but often can't decide what to play
        or don't feel like playing at all after a while. Probably
        the most consistant thing I like is talking about philosophy
        with friends and family. I also like programming. That's
        why I made it my job. Apart from that, there are thousands
        of disciplines I picked up for less than a day believing
        I could become the best over night and lost interest in.
        Some of them reemerge enough for me to give them more regular
        attention, like calligraphy (Both European and Asian) or
        playing the piano. I'm hoping to find the thing that I
        could do forever without losing interest and make it my
        job, but --- at the moment, at least --- programming is
	something I'm really passionate about and find generally
	fulfilling as a job.
