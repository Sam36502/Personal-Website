    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        So you want to know about me?
        Well, there's not much to know.
        <br>
        For one thing, I really don't like writing shit about myself, but
        it feels appropriate for a personal website to write something about
        me here so, here's the summary:
    </p>

    <h2>"Whence cometh such a foul beast? What land could spawn such grotesquityâ€½"</h2>
    <h3><i>"Where are you from?"</i></h3>
    <p>
        I was born in Switzerland, half raised in New Zealand,
        half in Switzerland, but somehow I feel more British than
        either of them. I can speak English and German (as well as
        Swiss-German) and now Toki Pona. My English accent is kinda
        weird as it's pretty much a mix of all the big ones, but I
        think I'm pretty decent at immitating accents, so I guess
        you could say it's anything I want.
    </p>

    <h2>"A countenance most foul! May no man look upon it, as long as he has eyes!"</h2>
    <h3><i>"What do you look like?"</i></h3>
    <p>
        I'm not really comfortable putting images of myself on the
        internet, but I'm also not so interested as to stop others
        if they take a picture of me and post it somewhere. I'm
        an obese, brown-haired, green-eyed mass of flesh and bones.
        I'm trying, and failing, to grow a beard, which means I
        just have that pathetic juvenile bum-fluff under my nose.
        I walk awkwardly and stand in an equally unappealing way,
        on account of the extra mass I've been porting my whole life.
        I would describe my general appearance as unkempt, but hey:
        at least I shower every day, so I have one up on those
        insolent mummy's boys that go to anime conventions and hold
        beliefs only shared by the extreme or archaic.
    </p>

    <h2>"The mind of such vulgar barbarities burgeons only with the thought of bringing anguish upon those who do not deserve it!"</h2>
    <h3><i>"What kind of stuff do you like?"</i></h3>
    <p>
        Sadly, I have very few pronounced interests and those are
        not at all very pronounced. I like to read, but not sometimes.
        I like to play games, but often can't decide what to play
        or don't feel like playing at all after a while. Probably
        the most consistant thing I like is talking about philosophy
        with friends and family. I also like programming. That's
        why I made it my job. Apart from that, there are thousands
        of disciplines I picked up for less than a day believing
        I could become the best over night and lost interest in.
        Some of them recur enough for me to give them more regular
        attention, like calligraphy (Both European and Asian) or
        playing the piano. I'm hoping to find the thing that I
        could do forever without losing interest and make it my
        job, but --- at the moment, at least --- that seems utterly
        impossible.
    </p>

    <h2>"No creature of such off-putting stature and manner could contain any breath of life than that of the souls of valiant but foolish men."</h2>
    <h3><i>"What are your general beliefs?"</i></h3>
    <p>
        I'd like to say I'm Agnostic, but I have faith in Atheism.
        I don't know why; I just think it's the most comforting
        religion, and <i>seems</i> correct, but I can't prove it at all.
        I have no problem with Religious people until they endanger
        others. Politically, I'm about as centrist as it gets. That
        normally manifests itself in the form of others with opinions
        claiming I'm part of "The Enemy". I try to implement the
        Stoicism of the ancient Greeks in my day-to-day life, with
        varying degrees of success. At least it's made me content
        with the idea of death, so that's a bonus.
