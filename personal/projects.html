    <h1>Unfinished Projects</h1>
    <p>
        Very often, I'll come up with a cool idea for a thing I'd like to make,
        but --- so far, at least --- in 99% of cases, I give them up before they
        reach any kind of presentable state. This is a list of all currently
        "Ongoing" projects, because I never officially declare any of them dead.
        Because of this, some of the projects are actually still being worked on,
        but I'd like to have them here so if I forget them, they're already in
        the list.
    </p>
    <i>Note: I made this a few years after the phenomenon became obvious, so this list is not extensive.</i>
