    <h1>My Copyright Policy</h1>
    <p>
        In my opinion, copyright nowadays lasts far too long.
        (70 years after creator's death, in most countries)
        I see no benefit to the public with this system; it
        exists because of, and for large companies to keep
        exclusive money-making rights on intellectual property.
        The result is the hindrance of creative progress.

        In an effort to protest this, I make following statement.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyright Statement:</h2>
    <p>
        I, Samuel Christophe Oscar Pearce, being of sound mind,
        do hereby declare that every piece of copyrightable
        material I produce in my lifetime shall enter the public
        domain no later than <strong>30 years</strong> after first
        publication. In the event that I die while still owner of
        some intellectual property ("the IP"), I hereby grant it to my parents
        and/or brother for joint owenership. If they do not decide
        when the IP should be enter public domain, it is automatically
        made part of the public domain one year exactly after the date of my death.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
    <p>
        I'm not a lawyer and don't know if this one statement
        will even be enough, but I do intent to attach a
        license to anything I might publish to clarify
        exactly when I revoke my copyright on it. I'm really
        only making this statement to make clear my stance,
        on the matter as a whole, and to hopefully clear things
        up, should I die unexpectedly and leave something
        un-public-domained.
    </p>
