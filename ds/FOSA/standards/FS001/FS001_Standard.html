				<i>FOSA Standard no. 001</i>
				<h2>Standard Standard</h2>
				<hr>
				<i>Author: Samuel Pearce</i><br>

				<h3>Contents</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Version</li>
					<li>Terminology</li>
					<li>Purpose</li>
					<li>Format of the Document</li>
					<li>Required Sections</li>
					<li>Approval</li>

				<h3>1 - Version</h3>
				<p>
				 VERSION: 1.0<br>
				 CHANGES:<br>
					No changes have been made.
				</p>
				
				<h3>2 - Terminology</h3>
				<p>
					Document:
					Any text-based data storage. This includes
					formatted texts such as HTML as well as
					plain, unformatted text. The text must be
					legible with a plain text editor.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3 - Purpose</h3>
				<p>
					The purpose of this document is to define how future
					standards shall be formatted. Any document, that
					adheres to this standard, is therefore to be clear
					enough, that it's use as a standard is possible.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4 - Format of the Document</h3>
				<p>
					The document must be formatted with a few minimum
					requirements. Each section must be clearly marked
					from the rest of the text, by a title. The title
					must bear the number of the section it denotes.
					At the beginning of the document, should be a title
					and the name of the author. Any other information
					about the author is optional.
				</p>
				
				<h3>5 - Required Sections</h3>
				<p>
					After the title and author information, there are
					three sections that are required, before the main
					standard content.
					
					The first required section is the changes section.
					In this section will be the current version of the
					standard. It must also be listed, which version is
					currently in effect.

					The next required section is the
					Terminology section. Here is where you can define
					terms that might be unclear or vague. An example
					might be the term "document" as used in this standard.
					What file format? On paper? Text file or Word document?
					The terminology section may be left out if all the
					language in the document is decided to be unambiguous.

					After that section, a short description of the purpose
					of the standard is required. This doesn't have to
					explainf in-depth how the standard should work, but
					merely what the standard is for. In this case for example
					is to define how the standards should be formatted.

					Finally the approval section. This does not have to be
					included in the standard, when it is submitted. This
					section will include the Name of the person who approved
					the standard as well as the current date, and the name
					of the signature file. The document can be verified
					with the signature file, to ensure it really was approved
					by the FOSA.
				</p>
