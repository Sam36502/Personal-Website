3 - Purpose
-----------
 As you may have heard, The international organization
 for standardization has a standard known as ISO3103 or
 "Tea -- Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests".
 If you have heard anything about the standard it's
 probably that they state:
	"If the test involves milk, then it is added before
	pouring the infused tea"
 This was even officially accepted by the United Kingdom.
 This standard is not for accurate tea testing at all.
 Herein lies the secret to making the BEST tea.
