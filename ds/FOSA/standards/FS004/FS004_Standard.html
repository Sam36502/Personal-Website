				<h3>1 - Version</h3>
				<p>
				 VERSION: 1.0<br>
				 CHANGES:<br>
					No changes have been made.
				</p>
				
				<h3>2 - Terminology</h3>
				<p>
					  HS-Code:
						Any visual code that
						conforms to this standard.
						Including variations defined
						in this document.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3 - Purpose</h3>
				<p>
					  The HS-Code Standard defines how to use
					 and implement the HS-Code system. The system
					 is a method of encoded communication that,
					 like a QR-Code can be read easily and posted
					 anywhere in the physical world, but has the
					 convenience of far simpler to implement. This
					 also means, that the code can be decoded using						 nothing more than a paper an pen, if necessary.
					 It also doesn't require any cameras or fancy
					 image recognition software to read the code if
					 it has been posted in the real world.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4 - Encoding</h3>
				<p>
					 To encode data to HS-Code format the bytes are
					 filled out to the maximum for the specified
					 variant. The end of the string is denoted by
					 a zero byte (0x00). Anything after the zero
					 byte can be completely random. These bytes are
					 then arranged into a grid. The top left square
					 of the grid is completely filled and the bottom
					 right square is reserved for the check digit.
					 Below is an example of a version 2 Code in it's
					 completed form.<br>
					 <pre><code>

						██ 00 01 02
						03 04 05 06
						07 08 09 0A
						0B 0C 0D 2F
					
					</code></pre>
					 The checksum is the digit to be added on to
					 the end so that the total sum of all digits
					 is evenly divisible by 69. In the example
					 above the checksum is 47, because the sum of
					 all digits in the square is 91 and:<br>
						(91 + 47) / 69 = 2<br>
					 Finally the checksum is converted to hex and
					 written in the bottom right of the square.
					 In the example above 47 => 0x2F.
				</p>
				
				<h3>5 - Decoding</h3>
				<p>
					 The first step of decoding should be checking if
					 all the digits were entered correctly be summing
					 up all digits in the square (including the check-
					 sum) and checking that it can be divided by 69
					 without any remainder. If this check passes the
					 decoding can begin.
					 Decoding is really quite simple, each grouping of
					 two hex digits is a single byte of data.
					 The lines are read from top to bottom, and each
					 line is read from left to right.
					 Below is a demonstration of the read directions with
					 a Version 2 HS-Code (CS = Checksum):<br>
					 <pre><code>

						██ >> >> >>
						>> >> >> >>
						>> >> >> >>
						>> >> >> CS
					</code></pre>
					 The pattern should be read like a book. This also
					 means that the orientation square can be anywhere
					 and that changes how the square should be read e.g:<br>
					<pre><code>
						^^ ^^ ^^ CS
						^^ ^^ ^^ ^^
						^^ ^^ ^^ ^^
						██ ^^ ^^ ^^
					</code></pre>
					 This allows the code to output at any angle and
					 still be understoon by a human reader.

					 All data is assumed to be ASCII text unless a format
					 is defined at the beginning of the code. The format
					 can be set by setting the first byte to a value below
					 32 according to the table below:<br>
					<table><br>
						<tr>
							<th>Byte</th>
							<th>Format</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0x00</td>
							<td>EOF</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0x01</td>
							<td>numbers, delimited by 0x01s</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0x02</td>
							<td>strings, delimited by 0x02s</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0x03</td>
							<td>floating point numbers, four bytes each</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0x04</td>
							<td>double precision floats, eight bytes each</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0x05</td>
							<td>Ceaser Cipher, second byte is the key</td>
						</tr>
					</table><br>

					 The bytes from 0x06 - 0x20 are undefined. Any suggestions
					 as to what could be added to the standard formats are
					 welcomed. See the contact page of the FOSA website:
						http://www.pearcenet.ch/fosa/contact.html

				</p>
				
				<h3>6 - Variations</h3>
				<p>
				 There are at least 11 officially supported
				 versions of the HS-Code. Each version is simply
				 the size of the square being used. For example
				 below is a version 1 and version 2 HS Code.<br>
				 <pre><code>
					->|  |<-	->|     |<-
					██ 01 02	██ 01 02 03
					03 04 05	04 05 06 07
					06 07 29	08 09 0A 0B
						        0C 0D 0E 21
				</code></pre>
				 The version number is the size of the square
				 in the centre. That means the size of the whole
				 square is the version number + 1. To calculate
				 the number of data tiles in an HS-Code, you can
				 use the formula:<br>
					Tiles = Version^2 + Version * 4 + 2<br>
				<br>
				 Valid checksums have been found for all versions
				 from 1 to 50. Although version 10 already becomes
				 rather unruly to "scan" by a human.
				 Technically, a version 0 is also possible and
				 would look like so:<br>
				 <pre><code>
					██ 01
					02 42
				</code></pre>
				 Here are all supported versions with the number
				 of bytes each can store:<br>
				 <table><br>
					<tr>
						<th>Version</th>
						<th>Capacity</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>2 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>7 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>14 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>23 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>34 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>47 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>62 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>79 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>8</td>
						<td>98 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>9</td>
						<td>119 B</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>10</td>
						<td>142 B</td>
