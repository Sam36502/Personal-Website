				<h3>1 - Version</h3>
				<p>
				 VERSION: 1.0<br>
				 CHANGES:<br>
					No changes have been made.
				</p>
				
				<h3>2 - Terminology</h3>
				<p>
					 CTML:
						Initialism as a name for the Console
						Text Markup Language.
					 Tag:
						A tag in CTML is any sequence of characters
						that begins with an open square bracket ([) and
						ends with a closed square bracket (]).
					 Element:
						An element is any region of text, including tags,
						that are surrounded by a beginning and end tag.
					 Attribute:
						Attributes are parts of a tag that describe how
						the content of the element should be displayed.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3 - Purpose</h3>
				<p>
					 The CTML Standard's Purpose is to define a markup language
					 that is more compatable with text based consoles as opposed
					 to graphical environments. The language is however still
					 fully compatible with graphical environments.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4 - Definitions</h3>
				<p>
					 A beginning tag contains an element keyword (See section 5)
					 surrounded by square brackets. Optionally attributes can be
					 defined inside the square brackets. All attributes are
					 seperated from the element keyword by a pipe character (|).
					 The attributes are made up of the attribute keyword and the
					 assigned value seperated by a colon (:). Each attribute is
					 seperated from each other by a comma. All spaces are ignored.
					 Examples:
						
						[p] --> A beginning paragraph tag
						[p| fg: red] --> A paragraph tag with red text
						[p| fg: green, bg: black] --> A paragraph with green
										  text and black background

					 An end tag is simply any tag that has a forward slash (/) in
					 the element keyword. Any attributes are ignored. If the user
					 wants to label their end tags it is allowed but not required.
					 Examples:<br>
					<br>
						[/] --> Valid end tag<br>
						[/p] --> Valid end tag<br>
						[/box] --> Valid end tag<br>
					<br>
					 Page elements can be nested inside each other with the "deepest"
					 attributes being applied. By default the background colour is
					 white and the foreground colour is black. 
					 Example:<br>
					<br>
						[p| fg: green, bg: black]<br>
						  This text is green on a black background.<br>
						  <br>
						  [p| fg: blue]<br>
							This text is blue on a black background.<br>
						  [/]<br>
						  <br>
						  This text is green on a black background.<br>
						[/]<br>
				</p>
				
				<h3>5 - Elements</h3>
				<p>
					 5-1	Paragraph (p)<br>
						The text is a paragraph by default has no formatting.
						This is plain text.
					<br>
					 5-2	First Heading (h1)<br>
						The first heading is Fully capitalized with a double
						underline, using the ASCII border characters.
						The text is offset from the edges by one whitespace:<br>
							<br>
							 FIRST HEADING<br>
							═══════════════<br>
							<br>
					 5-3	Second Heading (h2)<br>
						The second heading is the same as the first heading,
						except the text is not capitalized:<br>
							<br>
							 Second Heading<br>
							════════════════<br>
							<br>
					 5-4	Third Heading (h3)<br>
						The third heading is the same as the second heading,
						except the underline consists of single border
						characters:<br>
						<br>
							 Third Heading<br>
							───────────────<br>
						<br>
					 5-5	Fourth Heading (h4)<br>
						The fourth heading is the same as the Third heading,
						but there is no offset from the edges and the underline
						uses minus characters instead of border characters:<br>
						<br>
							Fourth Heading<br>
							--------------<br>
						<br>
					 5-6	Highlight (high)<br>
						By default this will set the background of any text it
						encompasses to yellow. The color can be changed with
						the 'bg' attribute.<br>

					 5-7	Box (box)<br>
						The box element creates a box at any position on the
						screen and any text inside it will wrap when it reaches
						the end of the box's width. If the starting column or
						starting row is not defined, it will just pick the left-
						most column or topmost row it can. If the width or height
						is not set it will simply take up as much space as possible.
						If the box runs out of room to display it's elements, it
						will add a scroll bar. If the padding attribute is set, any
						elements inside the box will have the amount of space from
						the edges of the box. if the box's margin attribute is set,
						That amount of space will be left around the outside of the
						box. Any elements outside the box will keep that much distance.<br>

					 5-8	Hyperlinks (link)<br>
						For a link element to lead anywhere when clicked on, it must
						have the href attribute set to a valid url. when the link is
						selected it will be highlighted. The default highlight colour
						is light grey, but this can be changed, by setting the sel
						attribute.<br>
				</p>
				
				<h3>6 - Usage</h3>
				<p>
					 All attributes have an index (listed here in square brackets)
					 that defines where this attribute should be stored in an array
					 of all possible attributes.<br>
					<br>
					 6-1	Foreground (fg) [0]<br>
						This attribute defines what colour the text will be
						written in.<br>
					<br>
					 6-2	Background (bg) [1]<br>
						This defines the background colour of any text in
						the current element.<br>
					<br>
					 6-3	Width (width) [2]<br>
						This defines the width of the current box element.<br>
					<br>
					 6-4	Height (height) [3]<br>
						Defines the height of the current box element.<br>
					<br>
					 6-5	Box X Coordinate (col) [4]<br>
						Defines after which column the current box should be drawn.<br>
					<br>
					 6-6	Box Y Coordinate (row) [5]<br>
						Defines after which row the current box should be drawn.<br>
					<br>
					 6-7	Select colour (sel) [6]<br>
						Sets what colour the background should be set to when<br>
						the element is selected.
					<br>
					 6-8	Margin (margin) [7]<br>
						Sets how many characters to leave around the current
						box element.<br>
					<br>
					 6-9	Padding (padding) [8]<br>
						Sets how many character to leave around the inside of
						the current box element.<br>
					<br>
					 6-10	Hyperlink Reference (href) [9]<br>
						Defines where a link will lead to when selected and
						entered by a user.<br>
