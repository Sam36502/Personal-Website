				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					Hello there!
					Somehow you have stumbled upon our Standards Association's website.
					However please note:
					
					<br><br><b class="red">This is not meant to be taken seriously</b><br><br>
					
					I am a Software Developer. Every now and then, I decided to define
					some new languages or something. And having watched some interesting
					videos about the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Standards Organization</a>
					I decided to throw together a quick website to organize my standards.
					
					If you have any simple standards of your own you'd like to register,
					it is completely free to do so under the 'Contact' page. Although you
					probably wont receive any recognition. In any case the document will
					be available to download from the internet and be referred to from other
					websites.
